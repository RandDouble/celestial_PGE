## How to compile

The project uses c++17 standard. It adheres to the standard in every way.
It uses as game engine the [olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine) made by javidx9 also known as [One Lone Coder](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder) under OLC-3 Licence.

### Windows User

It is provided a visual studio 2022 solution, so you will not run in any problem if you use Visual Studio 2022... 
I will not test it in Visual Studio 2019 or 2017, but if you want to do it, please report if all went well.

### Unix Like User

There is a Makefile, please use it, if it doesn't function edit until something happens.
So now we have a CMake that function... but only in linux envinroments (it is not so crossplatform)... so it is a great day to be a linux user :-).

#### Mac OS

I do not have a Mac... so I do not know, CMake couldn't be tested in Mac OS enviroments, so you need to modify it adding the feature requested for compilation
(**I think, but I DO NOT guaratee** that they should be very similar to linux flags exposed [here](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine/wiki/Compiling-on-Linux)).

## Functioning
